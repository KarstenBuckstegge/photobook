# photobook

Photobook is an educational project, trying to get me deeper into asynchronous (node) programming.
The goal is to recursively read a filetree and expose the found files to a frontend application.

On the way the different versions of asynchronous programming (callbacks, npm-modules, promises, async/await, â€¦) should be used to reach the goal.

==============

After the node part is done I would like to build a react (redux?) frontend application that uses the found data to display them in a automated slideshow.
